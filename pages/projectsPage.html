      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>An app where you can voice record your reminders!
        <br><br>
        The idea for our app came from wanting a faster, more natural way to keep track of 
        things in everyday life. 
        Typing out notes can feel slow or distracting, especially when you're busy, on the move, 
        or just want to capture a thought before it slips away. 
        We wanted something that made reminders effortless by just speaking, save, and keep going.
        Our motivation was to create a tool that feels intuitive, lightweight, and actually helpful 
        in those tiny moments when you need it most.

        <p>A fun cat fishing game!

        How To Play
        <br>
        CatFishn is a simple fishing game where the player controls a cat trying to catch fish.
		    The player uses the space bar to launch the fishing hook around the screen.
        The goal is to catch the Golden Fish.
        To catch the Golden Fish, the player must use the Golden fishing rod which can be purchased at the in-game store.
        The Golden fishing rod costs 500 points, which can be earned by catching regular fish.

        Work in progress project ...

        Aggie Market is a campus-based online marketplace for students. 
        The goal is to create a secure platform for buying, selling, 
        and promoting services or items within the university community.
        <br>
        Unlike platforms such as Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, 
        which can be difficult to navigate and may expose users to scams 
        or irrelevant listings, Aggie Market would restrict postings to 
        verified students only, by having a verified authentication with 
        institutional email (.edu) to buy and/or sell items, promote services, 
        and discover campus events. This aims to improve trust, safety, and ease of use.
        <br>
        Our goal is to create a centralized, safe platform for verified student 
        commerce and community engagement. By consolidating the fragmented
        experiences of other online marketplaces into a single verified 
        ecosystem. Aggie Market will reduce transaction risks, help 
        students save money, promote sustainability through item reuse, and 
        create income opportunities. This will create a peer-to-peer micro-economy built on campus.
